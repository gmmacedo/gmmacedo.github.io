Hello world! I am Gabriel Moura and I study geology and also amazed by the earth, it's processes and evolution, I always had a lot of interest in coding and, recently, in statistics, data science and so on. By 2017 I started my high school in the Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Norte and started to take geology classes there, by 2020 I started my college degree on the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.

In the Federal Institute I learned the basis of geology (mineralogy, petrography, notions of geophysics, geochemistry, etc.) and tools that would help me like geoprocessing and that was my main focus together with geochemistry.

In the Federal University I could deepen my knowledge about geology and obtain a whole new perspective of the world and it's transformations that happens all the time everywhere simultaneously, along side with this knowledge I had the oportunity to join a junior company where I performed geoprocessing and topography services and gained business experience in the role of people management and president.
